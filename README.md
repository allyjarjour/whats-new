# What's New?

This application was built with `create-react-app`. I was tasked with creating a news app that allows users to choose a topic to browse relevant articles. Users can also search articles based on keywords in the title. I tested the app with Jest and the React Testing Library to ensure proper functionality.

### Set Up

Clone down this repo.

1. On GitHub, create a new, empty repository and name it something like 'whats-new'.
2. Update the current remote (called "origin") so that it points at the URL of the repository you just created on GitHub. Read how to do this [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/changing-a-remotes-url).
3. Once you've updated the remote, you should run `npm install`, commit, and then push your initial commit to your personal repository. You will need to use the `-u` flag when you push (like this: `git push -u origin master`).
4. Run `npm start` to start up your React server. (You will see errors!)
